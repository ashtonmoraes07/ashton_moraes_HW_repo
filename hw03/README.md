For this assignment, I used basic UNIX commands to process the amazon reviews dataset. I used cut to select columns, sort to order data, and uniq -c to count the duplicates, along with wc -l to count lines. From the star-rating histogram, most reviews were 5 stars, followed by 4 stars. The top customers and products where mostly repeat buyers and popular items in electronic and toys, while categories like books and homie appeared most frequently. Overall, this assignment helped me practice basic data wrangling commands in UNIX.
